<p>  We are 3 siblings, 2 brothers. My mother is a single mother and a housewife<br>
and my father was a chemical engineer although he passed away several years ago.<br> 
My mother brought us up.She is a role model for us. She always took care of us and from her 
i learned the tactics of binding the families ties despite the regular family arguments and fights.<br>
I love spending time with my family and i think they are the most trusted individuals on earth.  </p>
